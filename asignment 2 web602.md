Questioning is the ability to organise our thinking around what we don't know - The Right Question Institue
According to Hitesh, questioning techniques are learning skills that encourage asking questions and knowing the correct answers. It leads to better interpersonal skills, and successful communication questioning also helps developers and designers archive their objectives better through specific and assertive responses. At the same time, questioning reduces miscommunication time and allows UX designers to focus on the actual problems.

For example:

For UX designers to understand which solution should be implemented, they should ask questions that fix users knowledge experience while directly relating to their problem, such as "how do you feel about the frequency ads on our web service as one of our loyal customers?"

#### Listening

While questioning ensures we get the correct information, listening helps secure that data, improve productivity, and avoid conflict and misunderstanding.
According to My Tools Content Team, by making a conscious effort, listening allows a complete message, which is the ideas or feelings of the speaker, to be understood, and it requires a lot of effort such reduce distracting elements, losing focus and mind wondering.

For Example:

When receiving feedback from users or stakeholders, depending on the topic and speaker opinion, the listener could be distracted and may only receive part of the message or the only part they need to focus on. Furthermore, if there is conflict in opinion, the listening process could also be disrupted with personal emotions and ideas.

### A2. List and explain any three UX principles.

#### 1. Use simple language

Just as minimalism has become one of the most famous principles in visual design, simple language is easy to understand and enhance the user experience by using clear and consistent words to reduce ambiguity.

According to Masooma, here are some factors to consider when choosing simple words for the design:

- Audience and purpose of the design: question who your audience is, what information they have, what they need, and what they will want to achieve with your communication
- Structure: ask about the common structures for your communication, what structures your readers are familiar with, and what sequence will be easy to read
- Design layout: focus on the typography, structure, and information graphics
- Expression: consider the tone, verbs, sentence length, jargon, and choice of words your communication will adopt
- Evaluation: have someone review the text you finalise and conduct a usability test.

#### 2.  Less is More

Proposed by architect [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe), less is more could be interpreted with the term minimalism used in the design and architecture.

Minimalist designers focus on the reduction the concept to its necessary elements and achieving simplicity. This design style supports users to focus on the important component and improve the browser experience while reducing the clutter design and distractions.

Apple adopted the principle in their phone's keyboard and the website.

#### 3. Meet the user's needs

Finally, the most important principle is focusing on users throughout the design process. According to Masooma, user experience (UX) indicates that the works should be centred around the user with your product or service.
It is easy to lose track of the purpose of the design and forget the design is made for the user, not the designer.

### A3. Provide a brief description of the following UX values:

#### Usefulness

A product that fails to fulfil user needs would fail to provide a meaningful user experience regardless of its design. Usefulness is when the product's features support user needs, and the products will be considered valuable. 

#### Aesthetics

According to an article on flowbohl.com, the visual aspect of a webpage can make or break in the emotional appeal of a product or interface. That emotion can create a lasting relationship. Aesthetics are not only an enticing entry point in a relationship and getting attention, but it also is a point of reassurance.

#### Usability

The term usability refers to how easily users can complete their intended task using a product. There are many types of issues related to users' ability to complete the tasks that they intend to perform, such as when customers access a webpage to purchase a particular product, but they cannot access the search bar or category, then they would give up and go to another site.

#### Functionality

According to an article from interaction-desigdn.org, functionality refers to whether a design works and helps the users meet their goals and needs. A functionality design would archive its purpose with consistent and reliable functions.

#### Desirability

While other UX values focus on visual design and content, desirability is about engaging users concerning their product's intended uses.

### A4. List any five methods which are used to gather information from users regarding the user experience

#### Personas

Personas are fictional characters created to represent different user types who might use services and products from the organisation. 

#### Prototyping

The goal of a prototype is to test and validate ideas before sharing them with stakeholders to identify and solve user pain points.

#### Focus group

A focused group is a group of deliberately selected people who participate in a facilitated discussion to obtain consumer perceptions about a particular topic or area of interest.

#### Contextual Interviews

Through observation and collaborative interpretation, the method presents users in their natural setting to gain more profound knowledge or their thinking process.

#### Eye-tracking

Eye-tracking is a usability testing technique that involves where the eye is focused or the motion of the eyes as individual views a webpage.

### A5. Describe what is meant by wireframes in user experience.

The wireframe is a web application layout that presents which interface components will exist on key pages. As one of the most crucial parts of the designing process, wireframes provide a visual understanding of a particular page of the website at the early stage. This could give early feedback and permission from stakeholders so the development team can start developing the solution. During the development process of a webpage, a wireframe is an initial iteration when the developer put the project's scope to the test while figuring out the business needs.
